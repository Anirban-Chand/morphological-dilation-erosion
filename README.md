NOTE: 
If you are using GIMP for image processing, then you should be aware of few things. After exporting a PGM image file into PBM format one line is added within the pbm file. If you open the exported PBM file into notepad then you can see the line "Created with GIMP" or something like that. I haven't considered this line. So, better if you remove this from the text file and then use the the image for this programs.
